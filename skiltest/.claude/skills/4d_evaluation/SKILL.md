# 4D Evaluation Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive, domain-agnostic guidance for quality assessment using the 4-Dimensional evaluation framework. It enables systematic evaluation of ANY deliverable using three universal dimensions: Product, Process, and Performance.

**This skill is completely domain-agnostic** - the same evaluation principles apply whether you're assessing a plan, a document, an analysis, a design, a system, or any other type of work. Quality is quality, regardless of what you're evaluating.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill automatically activates when:
- Evaluating completed work for quality
- Determining if deliverable meets excellence standards
- Deciding whether work needs refinement
- Providing coaching feedback on improvements
- Serving as a quality gate before accepting work

## Quick Start

For 80% of evaluations, follow these principles:

1. **Three Dimensions** - Evaluate what was delivered (Product), how it was built (Process), and quality standards (Performance)
2. **Evidence-Based** - Base assessments on concrete evidence, not impressions
3. **Universal Application** - Same criteria work for any type of deliverable
4. **Binary Verdict** - EXCELLENT (accept) or NEEDS REFINEMENT (iterate with coaching)
5. **Constructive Coaching** - If refinement needed, provide specific, actionable guidance

## Core Principles

### 1. **Universal Quality Standards**
Excellence criteria transcend contexts. Well-executed work shares the same quality attributes regardless of domain: correctness, completeness, clarity, appropriate complexity.

### 2. **Three-Dimensional Assessment**
Every deliverable evaluated across three lenses:
- **Product Discernment**: What was delivered (correctness, completeness, elegance)
- **Process Discernment**: How it was built (methodology, thoroughness, reasoning)
- **Performance Discernment**: Quality & excellence standards (NOT speed/efficiency)

### 3. **Performance = Quality, NOT Speed**
**CRITICAL:** "Performance" means quality and excellence, never runtime speed or efficiency.
- ✅ Performance: elegant, meets standards, fits patterns, improves overall quality
- ❌ NOT Performance: execution speed, resource usage, algorithmic complexity

### 4. **Evidence-Based Verdicts**
Every assessment backed by specific evidence. No vague criticism. Point to exact issues with references.

### 5. **Coaching Over Criticism**
When work needs refinement, provide actionable guidance showing the path to excellence.

## The 4D Framework

### Dimension 1: Product Discernment (What was delivered)

#### Correctness
- Is it accurate and free from errors?
- Does it function/work as intended?
- Are edge cases handled properly?
- Is the logic/reasoning sound?

#### Elegance
- Is it simple? (nothing to remove)
- Is it powerful despite simplicity?
- Is there unnecessary complexity?
- Could it be clearer or more direct?

#### Completeness
- Are there missing pieces?
- Is it fully functional/usable?
- Are all requirements addressed?
- Are there gaps or unfinished parts?

#### Problem-Solving
- Does it solve the real problem?
- Does it address root cause or just symptoms?
- Is the solution appropriate for the problem size?

### Dimension 2: Process Discernment (How it was built)

#### Sound Reasoning
- Was the approach logical?
- Were decisions well-reasoned?
- Is the methodology appropriate?

#### Thoroughness
- Were shortcuts taken?
- Are there hand-waving areas?
- Was research/analysis comprehensive?
- Were alternatives considered?

#### Appropriate Techniques
- Were best practices followed?
- Were relevant methods applied?
- Was the right approach used for the task?

#### Sustainability
- Is the approach maintainable long-term?
- Can it be extended or modified?
- Does it create future problems?

### Dimension 3: Performance Discernment (Quality & Excellence)

**REMEMBER: Performance = Quality/Excellence, NOT speed or efficiency**

#### Excellence Standards
- Does it meet excellence bar (not just "good enough")?
- Is quality high across all aspects?
- Would you be proud of this work?

#### Simplicity vs Power
- Is it elegant (simple yet powerful)?
- Is there over-engineering?
- Could it be simpler while maintaining effectiveness?

#### Pattern Consistency
- Does it fit established patterns?
- Is it consistent with existing approach?
- Does it feel like it belongs?

#### Net Improvement
- Does it make things better overall?
- Does it enhance quality of the situation?
- Does it improve clarity or usability?

## Verdict Determination

### EXCELLENT Verdict

**All three dimensions pass:**
- **Product**: Correct, elegant, complete, solves real problem
- **Process**: Sound reasoning, thorough, appropriate techniques, sustainable
- **Performance**: Meets excellence, simple yet powerful, fits patterns, improves quality

**Work is accepted and ready to use.**

### NEEDS REFINEMENT Verdict

**Any dimension has gaps:**
- Specific issues identified in Product, Process, or Performance
- Coaching feedback guides improvement
- Work returns for iteration

**Work not accepted until issues addressed.**

## Coaching Principles (for NEEDS REFINEMENT)

### 1. Specific
Point to exact issues with references:
- Identify the specific location or aspect
- State what's wrong or missing
- Explain the impact

### 2. Actionable
Clear what needs to change:
- Tell exactly what to add, remove, or modify
- Provide concrete steps
- Make the path forward obvious

### 3. Constructive
Focus on improvement, not criticism:
- ❌ "This is wrong" → ✅ "Consider adding X to address Y"
- ❌ "Poorly done" → ✅ "To strengthen this, try Z approach"
- ❌ "Missing stuff" → ✅ "Complete by adding A, B, C"

### 4. Prioritized
Most critical issues first:
1. Correctness issues (wrong information, broken logic)
2. Completeness gaps (missing required pieces)
3. Excellence improvements (good → great)

## Coaching Format

```markdown
**PRODUCT ISSUES:**
- [Specific issue with reference and impact]
- [Specific issue with reference and impact]

**PROCESS ISSUES:**
- [Specific issue with reference and impact]

**PERFORMANCE ISSUES:** (quality/excellence, NOT speed)
- [Specific issue with reference and impact]

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. [Priority 1: Most critical improvement]
2. [Priority 2: Important improvement]
3. [Priority 3: Quality enhancement]
```

## Excellence Standards Checklist

**Universal checklist for any deliverable:**

- [ ] **Correct** - Accurate, works as intended, no errors

**If ALL items pass → EXCELLENT**

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Vague Criticism
```
BAD: "This section needs work"
GOOD: "Section 3 missing analysis of X - add breakdown showing Y and Z"
```

### ❌ Performance = Speed Confusion
```
BAD: "Performance issue: this takes too long to execute"
GOOD: "Quality issue: this could be simplified to improve clarity"
```

### ❌ Accepting "Good Enough"
```
BAD: "It works, accept it"
GOOD: "It works, but needs refinement in elegance - see coaching"
```

### ❌ Harsh Criticism Without Coaching
```
BAD: "This is completely wrong"
GOOD: "Issue found: X is incorrect. To fix: do Y because Z"
```

### ❌ Assumptions About Context
```
BAD: "This code needs refactoring" (assumes software)
GOOD: "This could be simplified by restructuring the logic"
```

**Key Insight from Examples:**

Notice that the SAME evaluation questions apply in all three examples:
- Is it correct?
- Is it complete?
- Is it elegant?
- Does it solve the real problem?
- Was the approach sound?
- Was it thorough?
- Does it meet excellence?
- Is it simple yet powerful?

The framework is universal. Your context determines what you're evaluating, but the quality criteria remain constant.
