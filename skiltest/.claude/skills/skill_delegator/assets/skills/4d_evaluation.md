# 4d_evaluation Skill

## Domain

**Universal / Domain-Agnostic**

This skill provides knowledge for quality assessment across ANY context using the 4-Dimensional evaluation framework. The same quality criteria apply whether you're evaluating plans, documents, systems, analyses, designs, or any other deliverable.

## Activation Triggers

**Keywords:**
- "evaluate", "quality", "assessment", "review"
- "excellent", "refinement", "coaching"
- "is this ready", "does this meet standards"
- Quality gate contexts

**Use Cases:**
- 4d_evaluation agent needs assessment framework
- Evaluating completed work for quality
- Determining if deliverable meets excellence standards
- Providing coaching feedback on improvements
- Serving as quality gate before accepting work

**File Patterns:**
- N/A (this evaluates any type of deliverable)

## Core Knowledge

### The 4D Framework (Universal)

**Three Dimensions of Assessment:**

1. **Product Discernment** - What was delivered
   - Correctness, Elegance, Completeness, Problem-Solving

2. **Process Discernment** - How it was built
   - Sound Reasoning, Thoroughness, Appropriate Techniques, Sustainability

3. **Performance Discernment** - Quality & Excellence (NOT speed)
   - Excellence Standards, Simplicity vs Power, Pattern Consistency, Net Improvement

### Critical Understanding: Performance = Quality

**Performance Discernment evaluates QUALITY, never speed:**
- ✅ Is it elegant? Meets excellence standards? Fits patterns? Improves quality?
- ❌ NOT: How fast does it run? Resource usage? Algorithmic complexity?

### The Two Verdicts

**EXCELLENT:**
- All three dimensions pass
- Work is ready to accept and use

**NEEDS REFINEMENT:**
- Any dimension has issues
- Provide specific, actionable coaching
- Work returns for iteration

### Universal Quality Criteria

These questions apply to ANY deliverable:

**Product Questions:**
- Is it correct?
- Is it simple yet powerful?
- Is it complete?
- Does it solve the real problem?

**Process Questions:**
- Was the approach sound?
- Was it thorough?
- Were appropriate methods used?
- Is it sustainable?

**Performance Questions:** (quality, not speed)
- Does it meet excellence standards?
- Is it elegant?
- Does it fit established patterns?
- Does it improve the overall situation?

## Integration with Agents

## Example Activations

### Example 1: Quality Gate Assessment

```
4d_evaluation agent: *activates 4d_evaluation skill*

Following 4d_evaluation skill framework:

**Product Discernment:**
- Correctness: ✓ Accurate, logic sound
- Elegance: ✓ Simple yet effective
- Completeness: ✗ Missing component X
- Problem-Solving: ✓ Addresses root cause

**Process Discernment:**
- Sound Reasoning: ✓ Logical approach
- Thoroughness: ✓ Comprehensive
- Appropriate Techniques: ✓ Best practices applied
- Sustainability: ✓ Maintainable

**Performance Discernment:** (quality, NOT speed)
- Excellence: ⚠️ Good but incomplete
- Simplicity: ✓ Clean and clear
- Consistency: ✓ Fits patterns
- Net Improvement: ✓ Enhances quality

**Verdict:** NEEDS REFINEMENT

**Coaching:**
- Add missing component X (Product completeness issue)
- Specify exact location and what's needed
```

### Example 2: Excellence Confirmation

```
4d_evaluation agent: *activates 4d_evaluation skill*

Following 4d_evaluation skill framework:

**Product Discernment:**
- Correctness: ✓ Accurate, verified
- Elegance: ✓ Simple, nothing to remove
- Completeness: ✓ Fully addresses requirements
- Problem-Solving: ✓ Solves real problem

**Process Discernment:**
- Sound Reasoning: ✓ Well-reasoned approach
- Thoroughness: ✓ Comprehensive, no shortcuts
- Appropriate Techniques: ✓ Proven methods used
- Sustainability: ✓ Long-term maintainable

**Performance Discernment:** (quality, NOT speed)
- Excellence: ✓ High quality throughout
- Simplicity: ✓ Elegant balance
- Consistency: ✓ Fits established patterns
- Net Improvement: ✓ Enhances overall quality

## Coaching Principles

**When work NEEDS REFINEMENT:**

1. **Specific** - Point to exact issues with references
2. **Actionable** - Clear what needs to change

- A system
- A design
- Any other deliverable

The SAME questions apply:
- Is it correct?
- Is it complete?
- Is it elegant?
- Does it solve the problem?
- Was it built soundly?
- Does it meet excellence?

The 4D framework transcends domains. Quality is quality.
