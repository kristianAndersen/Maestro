# BaseResearch Skill: Methodology

Advanced research strategies and systematic investigation approaches.

## Research Frameworks

### Framework: 5-Step Investigation
1. **Define:** Clearly state research question
2. **Discover:** Find relevant sources
3. **Evaluate:** Assess source credibility
4. **Synthesize:** Connect and understand information
5. **Document:** Record findings and sources

### Framework: Breadth-First vs Depth-First

**Breadth-First (start here):**
- Get overview from multiple sources
- Understand scope and key concepts
- Identify areas needing deep dive

**Depth-First (once focused):**
- Deep dive into specific area
- Understand implementation details
- Master specific topic

## Source Evaluation

### CRAAP Test
- **Currency:** Is information current?
- **Relevance:** Does it answer your question?
- **Authority:** Is source credible?
- **Accuracy:** Is information correct?
- **Purpose:** Why was it created?

### Red Flags
- No author/date
- Conflicts with official docs
- No examples or evidence
- Overly promotional
- Outdated (check last update)

## Synthesis Techniques

### Progressive Summarization
1. Highlight key points while reading
2. Summarize highlights in own words
3. Create executive summary
4. Extract actionable insights

### Concept Mapping
Connect related ideas visually:
- Authentication → Sessions → Storage
- API → Endpoints → Methods → Parameters

### Comparative Analysis
Compare approaches across sources:
- What do all sources agree on?
- Where do they differ?
- Which is most authoritative?
